# Geometric Resonance

## An Algorithmic Philosophy for Professional Identity

**Geometric Resonance** emerges from the intersection of structured professionalism and dynamic creativity, where every shape represents a skill, every movement a career progression, and every interaction a professional connection. This philosophy transforms the static CV into a living, breathing ecosystem of geometric entities that dance between order and controlled chaos, mirroring the balance between technical expertise and creative innovation that defines modern digital professionals.

The algorithm begins with a systematic cataloging of geometric primitives - circles, rectangles, polygons - each assigned specific semantic meaning. Circles embody completeness and continuous learning, their outlines representing the ever-expanding boundaries of knowledge. Rectangles manifest as solid foundations of core competencies, their rotations indicating adaptability and perspective shifts. Polygons emerge as specialized skills, their varying sides counting the facets of expertise. These shapes are not randomly scattered but meticulously positioned along a sine wave trajectory, creating a visual rhythm that suggests both mathematical precision and organic flow. On desktop displays, this wave flows from bottom-left to top-right, suggesting upward career momentum. On mobile, it inverts from top-left to bottom-right, optimizing for thumb-friendly interaction zones while maintaining visual hierarchy.

The sine curve positioning is no arbitrary choice but a carefully crafted mathematical poetry. Each shape's initial position is calculated as `y = amplitude * sin(frequency * x + phase) + baseline`, where the amplitude varies based on screen dimensions, frequency creates clustering patterns that group related skills, and phase offsets prevent overwhelming visual collision. This creates regions of density and breathing space, much like the ebb and flow of project intensity throughout a career. The shapes pulse with micro-animations - subtle breathing effects where scale oscillates between 0.95 and 1.05, rotation that slowly evolves based on time and user proximity, and opacity shifts that create depth layers. These are not random movements but carefully orchestrated behaviors driven by interconnected force fields and attraction points.

Color becomes a language of professional evolution. The palette draws from deep ocean blues (#0A3A52, #004B72) representing depth of experience, punctuated by cyan highlights (#3E9FD4, #6ACBFF) for moments of innovation, and strategic red accents (#F0000F, #FF1322) marking pivotal achievements. Each shape's color is determined by its category, position on the sine curve, and interaction state. As users navigate between CV sections, shapes respond with color transitions that ripple outward from interaction points, creating a visual narrative of exploration. The implementation uses HSL color space for smooth transitions, with hue shifts confined to harmonious ranges that maintain professional aesthetics while allowing expressive variation.

The interaction model transforms passive viewing into active discovery. Shapes exhibit three behavioral states: dormant (gentle floating within constrained bounds), aware (subtle orientation toward cursor position), and engaged (dynamic response to direct interaction). When the cursor approaches, nearby shapes enter the aware state, their movements becoming more pronounced, creating a wake effect that ripples through the geometric field. Click interactions trigger shape transformations - circles might reveal skill percentages, rectangles could flip to show project details, polygons morph to display achievement metrics. These interactions are throttled and optimized, using quadtree spatial indexing to ensure smooth performance even with hundreds of elements. The mobile experience adapts through touch-specific behaviors - tap to focus, swipe to disperse, pinch to cluster - making the geometric field feel native to touch interfaces.

This is not merely decorative geometry but a meticulously engineered visualization system where every parameter has been refined through countless iterations. The sine wave amplitude adjusts based on viewport aspect ratio using golden ratio proportions. Shape distribution follows Fibonacci spacing for natural clustering. Animation timing uses cubic-bezier easing curves calibrated to feel both responsive and elegant. The entire system is built on a seeded random foundation, ensuring reproducible layouts while maintaining organic variation. Performance optimization includes RequestAnimationFrame scheduling, off-screen culling, and level-of-detail rendering that adjusts complexity based on device capabilities. This is the work of a master craftsperson who understands that true algorithmic beauty emerges from the perfect balance of mathematical rigor, aesthetic sensitivity, and technical excellence. Every shape, every movement, every interaction has been considered, tested, and refined to create a living portfolio that breathes with professional vitality.
