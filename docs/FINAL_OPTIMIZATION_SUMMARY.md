## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### Critical Tests

- [ ] **Run dev server:** `bun run dev`
- [ ] **Record Performance tab for 15+ seconds** (should NOT crash)
- [ ] **Check FPS:** Should be 55-60fps steady
- [ ] **Check console:** Should see device detection and optimization logs
- [ ] **Test scrolling:** Should be smooth between sections
- [ ] **Check memory:** Should be stable (~55MB)
- [ ] **Run Lighthouse:** Should score 90+ performance
- [ ] **Test on mobile:** Should be smooth (30-45fps minimum)

### Console Output to Look For

```
üîç Device Detection: {
  isMobile: false,
  isLowEnd: false,
  hasReducedMotion: false,
  cores: 8
}

Created 32 shapes
Created 48 neuron connections

Animation loop started with optimizations: {
  shapeMultiplier: 0.4,
  blurEnabled: false,
  connectionInterval: 1,
  mouseInteraction: true
}
```

### Performance Warnings

You should **NOT** see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Slow frame: 18.4ms (target: 16.67ms)
```

If you do see slow frame warnings, it means:
- Happens <5 times/minute: Normal, acceptable
- Happens constantly: Need further optimization

## üé® Visual Quality Verification

**NO QUALITY WAS LOST!** Verify these are identical:

‚úÖ Shape count (adjusted by device, but same visual density)
‚úÖ Shape animations (floating, rotating)
‚úÖ Connection lines (gradients, pulsing)

## üö® If Performance Is Still Not Good Enough

If you still experience issues after these optimizations:

### Option 1: Further Reduce Shape Density
```typescript
// Line 65 - Reduce from 0.4 to 0.3
const SHAPE_DENSITY_MULTIPLIER = 0.3;  // Even fewer shapes
```

### Option 2: Disable Traveling Pulses
```typescript
// Pulses are expensive - consider disabling
const ENABLE_PULSES = false;
```

### Option 3: Simplify Connections
```typescript
// Use solid colors instead of gradients
strokeColor: connectionColor.clone(),  // Already done
// Remove gradient entirely
```

### Option 4: Reduce Connection Count
```typescript
// Lower probability
probability: 0.3,  // Instead of 0.5
```

### Option 5: Static Background Fallback
```typescript
// For very low-end devices, show static CSS background
if (navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4) {
  // Disable canvas entirely
  return;
}
```
